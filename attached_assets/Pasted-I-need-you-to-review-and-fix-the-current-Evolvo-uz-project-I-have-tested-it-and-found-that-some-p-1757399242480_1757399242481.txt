I need you to review and fix the current "Evolvo.uz" project. I have tested it and found that some parts are working, but others are not. Please fix all issues and ensure the entire platform works as intended.

Here’s what’s NOT working (based on my testing):

1. 🤖 AI Assistant on Service Detail pages:
   - AI does not respond to user questions.
   - AI responses are not in Uzbek language.
   - AI prompt templates are not stored or used correctly.

2. 📱 Telegram Bot Integration:
   - After submitting an order, no message is sent to the client or admin channel.
   - Telegram bot token or channel ID may be misconfigured.

3. 📅 Automatic Blog Posts:
   - Posts are not being generated at 23:00 for the next day.
   - Posts are not being published to Telegram at 07:00, 09:00, etc.
   - Images are repeating — no 90-day uniqueness check.

4. 👨‍💼 Admin Panel:
   - Login is not working — authentication fails.
   - Orders are not displayed in the dashboard.
   - Cannot change order status (New → In Progress → Completed).

5. 🗃 Database Issues:
   - Orders are not saved to the database after form submission.
   - Blog posts are not saved with image_unsplash_id for uniqueness tracking.

6. ⚙️ Cron Scheduler:
   - setInterval functions for daily post generation and publishing are not running or misconfigured.

7. 🌐 SEO & Language:
   - Some pages lack proper meta tags (title, description).
   - Some content is not in Uzbek language.

## ✅ REQUIRED FIXES:

1. Fix AI Assistant:
   - Ensure AI responses are in Uzbek.
   - Store AI prompt templates in the `services` table.
   - Use Gemini API correctly — check API key and prompt format.

2. Fix Telegram Integration:
   - Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID` in .env.
   - Test sendMessage API with correct chat_id and parse_mode.
   - Send confirmation to client AND admin channel.

3. Fix Automatic Blog Posts:
   - Ensure cron.js runs daily at 23:00 to generate 7 unique posts.
   - Ensure scheduler.js runs every 2 hours (07:00, 09:00, etc.) to publish posts.
   - Implement 90-day image uniqueness — store and check `image_unsplash_id`.

4. Fix Admin Panel:
   - Fix login authentication (bcrypt password hashing).
   - Display orders in dashboard with status and client info.
   - Allow admin to update order status.

5. Fix Database:
   - Ensure orders are saved after form submission.
   - Ensure blog_posts table includes `image_unsplash_id` and checks for duplicates.

6. Fix Cron Scheduler:
   - Ensure setInterval is correctly implemented in server.js or cron.js.
   - Log messages to console for debugging (e.g., “Generating daily posts...”).

7. Fix SEO & Language:
   - Add missing meta tags to all pages.
   - Ensure all AI-generated content is in Uzbek.
